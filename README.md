- 👋 Hi, I’m @STEMMUnity.  We are a non-profit. We have teamed up with a local community college to develop a 9 month program for local middle and high school students to build a quadcopter from "scratch."
- 👀 I’m interested in ...learning to code Arducopter.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... that one has to start slow and build a solid foundation, rather than thinking they can do everything at once.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...learning to code a Arducopter
- 📫 How to reach me ... email - STEMMUnity@gmail.com
